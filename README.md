I'm a software engineer from KoÅ¡ice, Slovakia. I enjoy building stuff.

### What I'm up to currently

I'm working towards my PhD under supervision of [Prof. Ivo PetrÃ¡Å¡, DrSc.](http://people.tuke.sk/ivo.petras/) at [Faculty of Mining, Ecology, Process Control and Geotechnologies](https://www.tuke.sk/wps/portal/tuke/faculties/fberg/), [Technical University of KoÅ¡ice](https://www.tuke.sk/wps/portal/tuke). At the [Institute of Control and Informatization of Production Processes](http://web.tuke.sk/uraivp/en/), I teach JavaScript programming in two courses, one for undergrads and another for graduate students. Additionally to that, I also teach Java and some presentation skills there.
