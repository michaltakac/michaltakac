I'm a software engineer from Ko≈°ice, Slovakia. I enjoy building stuff.

### What I'm up to currently

In July 2025, I joined [Sudolabs](https://sudolabs.com/), where we build software for startups and enterprises.

In May 2025, I founded RandomFour LLC, a US company for my solo indie projects, which I work on during nights and weekends.

In 2021, I founded [DimensionLab](https://dimensionlab.org), where we worked on next-generation engineering and scientific software, building the Siml.ai Platform for PhysicsML. Unfortunately, we ran out of money, and my health problems worsened; therefore, we stopped working on it in April 2025 and sunsetted Siml.ai.

I'm also a board member of [Paraleln√° Polis Ko≈°ice](https://www.paralelnapoliskosice.sk/) and founder of [QuestSpace hackerspace](https://questspace.sk/?lang=en). We've established a physical presence in the heart of Ko≈°ice city on Hlavn√° 36 street - come for a great coffee and hacking on some collaborative projects!

Beside that I'm sometimes coding random crypto projects for fun!

### Past experiences

In 2021, I successfully defended my PhD dissertation "Design and Implementation of Modern Methods for Modeling and Control of Technological Objects and Processes" under supervision of [Prof. Ivo Petr√°≈°, DrSc.](http://people.tuke.sk/ivo.petras/) at [Faculty of Mining, Ecology, Process Control and Geotechnologies](https://www.tuke.sk/wps/portal/tuke/faculties/fberg/), [Technical University of Ko≈°ice](https://www.tuke.sk/wps/portal/tuke). In my dissertation, I wrote a cross-platform GPU-optimized solver that uses Lattice-Boltzmann Method to achieve real-time interactive CFD simulation of simple vortex shedding, and I manage to implement an integrated visualization environment where user interacted with real-time simulation within virtual reality. Here's a short video:



In 2020, I was Visiting Student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) at [Institute of Transportation Studies](https://its.berkeley.edu/).

During my PhD, I taught JavaScript programming in two courses, one for undergrads and another for graduate students. Additionally to that, I also taught Java and a presentation skills course there.

Before that...

- I did WebVR at [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/),
- helped build apps for startups at [Sleighdogs](https://sld.gs/),
- experimented with using WebVR for mathematics with [MathworldVR](https://mathworldvr.com) ([won Falling Walls Lab Slovakia 2020](http://fwlslovakia.sk/2020/10/03/fwls-2020-winners/) with this project, profile also at [Falling Walls website](https://falling-walls.com/people/michal-takac/)), and here's the [video of my presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGyR8zbJFuE) that includes short MathworldVR demo,
- founded skateboarding scoring platform [SkateRank](https://skaterank.com/) (was active between 2018-2020, remnants still available on it's [FB profile](https://www.facebook.com/skaterank/)),
- co-founded a startup for house 3D printing Instant House Construction which we decided to abandon,
- did a small gig at [Veterinary University of Ko≈°ice](https://www.uvlf.sk/en) developing maintenance management software,
- founded tracking software Runelytics for an online game Runescape,
- done some Wordpress stuff for nearly 2 years at HP Publishing s.r.o. (worked closely with the founder, Radek Hru≈°ka) who published [Boardmag](https://www.bigmag.cz/?page=casopis&id=100&lang=en) and [Dirtbiker](https://www.bigmag.cz/?page=casopis&id=101&lang=en) magazines in Czech republic and Slovakia,
- and beside that worked on various small projects.
