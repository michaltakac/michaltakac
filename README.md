I'm a software engineer from Ko≈°ice, Slovakia. I enjoy building stuff.

### What I'm up to currently

In 2021 I've founded [DimensionLab](https://dimensionlab.org), where we're working on next-generation engineering and scientific software. Beside that I'm coding random crypto projects for fun!

### Past experiences

In 2021, I successfully defended my PhD dissertation "Design and Implementation of Modern Methods for Modeling and Control of Technological Objects and Processes" under supervision of [Prof. Ivo Petr√°≈°, DrSc.](http://people.tuke.sk/ivo.petras/) at [Faculty of Mining, Ecology, Process Control and Geotechnologies](https://www.tuke.sk/wps/portal/tuke/faculties/fberg/), [Technical University of Ko≈°ice](https://www.tuke.sk/wps/portal/tuke).

In 2020, I was Visiting Student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) at [Institute of Transportation Studies](https://its.berkeley.edu/).

During my PhD, I taught JavaScript programming in two courses, one for undergrads and another for graduate students. Additionally to that, I also taught Java and a presentation skills course there.

Before that...
